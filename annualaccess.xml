      <title>The Spiritual Exercises, Episode 8: Self Examination</title>
      <link>https://truerestoration.org/the-spiritual-exercises-episode-8-self-examination</link>
      <description>In this week's lecture Father moves on to a more practical topic, self examination. As fallen human beings we have a tendency to sin, and if we are to progress in the spiritual life we must understand how this manifests itself in ourselves. Father Trauner explains practices from the Ignatian method which can help us fight these tendencies, namely a particular resolution, morning examination and evening examination of conscience.</description>

      <title>The Spiritual Exercises, Episode 7: The Use of Creation</title>
      <link>https://truerestoration.org/the-spiritual-exercises-episode-7-the-use-of-creation</link>
      <description>"Everything else on earth has been created on earth has been created for man's sake to attain the purpose for which he was created." This week in our study of the Spiritual Exercises Father Trauner explains our relationship with the rest of creation in these terms. It quickly becomes clear that to use the creation properly we must keep moderate our use of God's creatures in light of our own spiritual lives, despite our urge to use creators for temporal gain and pleasure.</description>

      <link>https://truerestoration.org/the-spiritual-exercises-episode-6-the-fundamental-principal</link>
      <description>"Man has been created to praise, reverence and serve our Lord God, thereby saving his soul." Father Trauner goes over this proposition, the meaning of it, and it's consequences. As this is the fundamental principle behind the retreat, it is essential that we all understand and internalize it, otherwise we become like a ship setting out without a destination.</description>

      <title>The Sinner's Guide, Episode 8: True Liberty</title>
      <link>https://truerestoration.org/the-sinners-guide-episode-8-true-liberty/</link>
      <description>Today as we conclude &lt;a href="https://truerestoration.org/press/the-sinners-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;The Sinner's Guide&lt;/a&gt; for Season 13 we study the remaining privileges of the just including true liberty. It becomes very clear that the liberty of the world we live in is more often really slavery to sin and is clearly opposed to the true liberty of soul that is given to the just.</description>

As he explores the book it becomes quite clear that a clean conscience is a great blessing and one we should never take for granted.</description>

      <description>In this episode of &lt;a href="https://truerestoration.org/press/the-sinners-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;The Sinner's Guide&lt;/a&gt; Fr. Larrabee continues with the motives for gratitude to God. Today we are prompted to meditate on the grace of being raised or converted to Catholicism, which so many people now and throughout history haven't had. Through God's mercy we have been given the grace of the Faith and, if we follow Him  faithfully, we can hope for eternal salvation. What could we be more grateful for than this undeserved gift? After this happy reflection Father moves to a more somber subject, the first of the four last things.</description>

  We are pleased to present a new ongoing project here at True Restoration - From the Archives: Fr Donald Sanborn Q and A! This content will draw from an old television series that ran in the late 1980's to the early 1990's and featured various Traditional Catholic Clergy expounding on the teachings of Holy Mother Church along with current events; similar to our Behind the Headlines project which featured Bp. Dolan and Fr. McKenna.
    All these episodes live freely on the internet, but for our annual membership we've taken up the task of producing a more polished version of the content in podcast format and focusing on the valuable insights and knowledge of the then Fr. Donald Sanborn. We offer these episodes as a special bonus which will be released throughout the year exclusively to our annual members at the $150 Tier and above. Please enjoy these episodes of vintage Bp. Donald Sanborn!

      <description>Another key aspect of growth in the spiritual life is silence. This silence is not only external, it is internal as well. We must create a space for Our Lord to speak to us, and He cannot be heard over the noise many of us allow in our minds and hearts.&#xD;

      <link>https://www.truerestoration.org/progress-in-prayer-episode-1-a-prayerful-orientation</link>
      <description>Many Catholics are afraid of prayer, in part because they don’t conceive properly of what it is: not just a conversation with your Creator, but a way of being, a mindset, a way to penetrate all the actions of your waking day. In this first episode of a new series, Fr. Arnold Trauner and host Stephen Heiner set the table for a season-long look at prayer.&#xD;

      <description>After establishing the historical background in the first episode 48, Ethan and Fr. Dutertre delve deeply into the contents of the bull. As we continue our study of the bull, it becomes evident how clearly the papacy has condemned the notion that papal authority is dependent upon any entity other than Christ himself. Further, we get into an explanation of the condemnations of the Jansenist and Lutheran propositions which the synod of Pistoia had put forward.&#xD;

We begin the show with a discussion of the historical context of Auctorem Fidei and the infamous synod of Pistoia which it was written in response to. After building a historical foundation Fr. Duterte goes on to explain the Pope Pius VI's condemnation of the synod of Pistoia and the parallels between it and Vatican II.&#xD;

      <title>Popes Against the Modern Errors, Episode 46: Satis Cognitum (Part 1)</title>
      <link>https://www.truerestoration.org/popes-against-the-modern-errors-episode-46-satis-cognitum-part-1/</link>
      <description>In this episode, Fr. Dutertre and Ethan begin a discussion on Satis Cognitum by Pope Leo XIII. The show begins with a history of the interest in church unity during the 19th century, culminating in the modernists efforts to promote their false ecumenism. Having laid the groundwork, Father then explains how this encyclical clearly distinguishes the Catholic church from heretical and schismatic sects as the One, True Church of Christ.</description>

      <link>https://www.truerestoration.org/trad-reviews-episode-36-the-simple-life/</link>
      <description>While many films glorify the exploits of outstanding characters, few of us are called to emulate this type of heroism. Today we'll look at a pair of films that focus on that "simple life" which most of us are called too. Both movies transport viewers to small town America in the 1940s, immersing them in sweet and beautiful narratives that depict the simple joys and struggles of everyday life.</description>

      <link>https://www.truerestoration.org/trad-reviews-episode-34-aviation-films/</link>
      <description>In the 1940s World War II films figured prominently in American cinema as filmmakers joined in the war effort. Today we'll look at two such war films which depict the heroic exploits of American air crews. These war films strike a great balance between showing the extreme conditions of war and, at the same time, the humanity of the soldiers who found themselves there. Continuing our focus on the open skies we'll also look at a different type of airplane centred entertainment -- flight simulators.</description>

      <description>In this episode, we take a deep dive into the classic film, The Nuns Story staring Audrey Hepburn. The film takes us on a journey into the life of a nun and shows us in stunning detail what such a life entails. It takes us also on the spiritual journey one goes through in such a life a life filled with many joys but also many crosses. In a larger sense however, and with the passing of time, our film can take on a whole new meaning when viewed through the lens of the current crisis we are living through in the aftermath of Vatican II, and we get a glimpse of just how much we truly lost.</description>

      <description>In this episode, we'll focus on two western films, both of which were directed by John Wayne and starred John Ford. These films showcase the romance and beauty of the old American West as well as the life and death struggle that was frontier life. While the "Old West" of film is only an idealized version of history, its a great antidote to the decadence and sterility of modern society.</description>

      <link>https://www.truerestoration.org/iota-unum-episode-34-sacraments-the-eucharist/</link>
      <description>The Eucharist is at the heart of all the other sacraments. If it is not properly understood for what it is, a sacrifice that produces the true Body, Blood, Soul, and Divinity of Our Lord Jesus Christ, it is as worthless as the Vatican 2 sect treats it.</description>

      <description>Baptism is the entrance into the Christian life through sanctifying grace. Marriage is an indissoluble union which Our Lord blessed by performing his first miracle at one. Vatican 2 seeks to undermine both of these sacraments by lessening their importance, and in the case of marriage, by seeking to make it dissolvable.</description>

Trauner explains how the Modernists sought to relegate Thomism to simply one idea among many, and worse, as simply a method, rather than a system of thought.</description>

Holy Mass Does Not Hinder Our Work, but Helps Us with It.</description>

      <description>In this episode of From the Archives: Fr Donald Sanborn Q and A, the then Fr. Sanborn discusses the Second Vatican Council and the freedom of conscience that resulted from it. Are the errors we see in the Novus Ordo only the result of bad clergy not following the hierarchy, as some would claim? How did Vatican 2 ever even happen?</description>

      <description>We should pray for the dead that they may rest in peace. Let us offer to God the sacrifice of justice and then trust in the Lord that we will also rest in peace in the end. When we offer Mass we are giving God infinite satisfaction, honor, and service. We are making reparation for our sins. Better than almost any other possible way. Chapters: 21. Holy Mass is the Most Certain Hope of the Dying; 22. Holy Mass is the Unfailing Succor of the Departed. </description>

      <description>In this season finale of Our Lady in Doctrine and Devotion, we find Our Lady in Jerusalem entering her time of sorrow during the Passion of Our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. How much did Our Lady know beforehand as to what would transpire? What does it mean for her to be our Co-Redemptrix; a belief that has been attacked by Jorge Bergoglio commonly known as "Pope Francis." Father as always guides us through these and other considerations as we seek to better know Our Lady's Sorrowful Heart.</description>

From there, the discussion moves on to the loss of the Child Jesus and the subsequent finding of Him in the Temple. As always Fr. Nkamuke explains not only the events, but the deeper lessons which we may take and apply to our own spiritual lives.  </description>

While it would be best to start listening to this series from the beginning, it is possible to listen to this group of episodes before going back to the start.  We can never know enough about this terrible enemy of Christianity.&#xD;

      <title>Why the Cross? Episode 1: Frenetic Intemperance</title>
      <link>https://www.truerestoration.org/why-the-cross-episode-1-frenetic-intemperance/</link>
      <description>Restoration Radio listeners over the years may have been used to hearing Fr. Trauner and Stephen discuss history and doctrine, but this season they will have a chance to hear them discuss spiritual matters using the text Why the Cross by Fr. Edward Leen, C.S.Sp.&#xD;
&#xD;
The approach in each episode will be to share a few quotes from the text on a specific theme and have Father develop the ideas a bit further.&#xD;
&#xD;
The series is no substitute for actually reading the book, and we hope that these episodes may whet the appetite of our listeners for the material, which they can find in our bookstore.&#xD;
&#xD;
In this episode Father covers: the frenetic intemperance with which modern man lives his life; the desire of modern man to “add a cubit to his stature”; the inability of modern man to be still and know that God is God.</description>

      <description>In this episode of The Councils, Father and Stephen look at the legacy of the Council of Trent.  We still live in a “post-Trent” era, one that Christians for 1500 years never saw.  Things that came out of the Council that we now take as givens include: A Universal Catechism and Calendar;a Code of Canon Law (which would be finally collected and issued under St. Pius X in one volume); a standard Mass and breviary; seminaries and universal training standards for priests; Bishops only holding one see and residing in that see; regular synods held by bishops; the Index of Forbidden Books; Congregation of Rites; Congregation of the Council. This is one of the most important Councils in Church history and certainly the most important in our era.</description>

      <description>Unsurprisingly, as they frequently do in the Old Testament (and the New), the Jews show their infidelity to the commands of the Lord and pay the price for disobedience.  In the New Testament segment Our Lord gives His magnificent Bread of Life discourse.</description>

      <description>Our Lord is not just clear and exacting on how He wants the Tabernacle to be built, but also how He wishes to be worshipped.  Father and Stephen also discuss the Miracles of the Loaves and the Fishes and Our Lord’s walking on water.</description>

      <description>This episode was recorded after the release of Bergoglio’s monstrous Fratelli Tutti, and is ever more relevant as Professor Amerio argues for the Church’s positions on the death penalty (always approved) and war (only when just) and how those subjects should be examined in a post-WW2 world.</description>

      <description>Professor Amerio wrote this book in the 1980s and passed away in the late 1990s, so he would quail to see what has happened regarding these issues now.  Nevertheless, his helpful documentation shows silly arguments being advanced in favor of divorce and abortion by bishops who should be guardians of marriage and the lives of the innocent, respectively.</description>

      <description>Professor Amerio talks about the philosophical problems of Pyrrhonism (a skepticism of knowledge of basic truths) and Mobilism (the process of endless “searching” for truth) and how the imprecise and silly term “dialogue” relates to both of them.  Once again we see a long shadow that would manifest in Bergoglio many decades later.</description>

      <link>https://www.truerestoration.org/tradreviews-episode-22-the-life-and-miracles-of-st-cuthbert/</link>
      <description>In this episode of Trad Reviews, we will be discussing the account of the Life and Miracles of St. Cuthbert, written by St. Bede the Venerable. After a brief introduction to Sts. Bede and Cuthbert, we will examine the Life and Miracles of St. Cuthbert chronologically, picking up and discussing miracles found to be particularly edifying in today's age. Naturally, this work is attractive to any Catholic, but it is particularly endearing owing to it being an easy read (especially being written by a Doctor of the Church); anyone with an interest in the early English Church will find this book to be an edifying example of the holiness of the English saints, but all will benefit from St. Cuthbert's example, as shown in the review.</description>

      <description>This Council occurred not long after what had been a 3 year vacancy of the Holy See as well as the tragic sack of Constantinople by a sidetracked Fourth Crusade.  Blessed Gregory X presided over this Council and, with great assistance from St. Bonaventure, managed to get a formal decree of union signed between the Latin and Greek churches.  Unfortunately, it would not last long.  St. Thomas Aquinas also died on the way to this council.</description>

      <link>https://www.truerestoration.org/the-councils-episode-6-council-of-ephesus-part-ii-nestorius-condemned/</link>
      <description>The drama of this Council is high, as it begins with a great victory, as Our Lady is proclaimed Theotokos, but quickly devolves into tragedy, as political machinations by bishops lead to a false council running parallel to the true council. </description>

      <description>Not content to attack Our Lord’s or the Holy Spirit’s divinity, the forces of evil turn to Our Lady through the heretic Nestorius, and attack the title of Our Lady as “Mother of God,” reducing her merely to “Mother of Christ,” i.e. as the heretics would have us believe, a mother of a purely human entity. </description>

      <description>Such luminaries as St. Gregory of Nazianzen, St. Gregory of Nyssa, and St. Cyril of Jerusalem are included in this important council, which dealt with the new heresies which grew from Arianism, but also was the first ecumenical council neither convoked by the Holy Father nor attended by his legates. </description>

      <description>Although not counted as one of the ecumenical councils of the Church, the Council of Jerusalem is nevertheless important to study as a “template” for how Councils work, as well as to see that how Church government worked in Apostolic times was very similar to how it was worked since.&#xD;
